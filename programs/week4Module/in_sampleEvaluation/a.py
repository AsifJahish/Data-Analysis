# 4. Measures for In-Sample Evaluation
# When evaluating our models, not only do we want to
# visualize the results, but we also want a quantitative measure to determine how accurate the model is.
#
# Two very important measures that are often used in Statistics to determine the accuracy of a model are:
#
# R^2 / R-squared
# Mean Squared Error (MSE)
# R-squared
#
# R squared, also known as the coefficient of determination, is a measure to indicate how close the data is to the fitted regression line.
#
# The value of the R-squared is the percentage of variation of the response variable (y) that is explained by a linear model.
#
# Mean Squared Error (MSE)
#
# The Mean Squared Error measures the average of the squares of errors. That
# is, the difference between actual value (y) and the estimated value (Å·).
