# Descriptive Statistical AnalysisÂ¶
# Let's first take a look at the variables by utilizing a description method.
#
# The describe function automatically
# computes basic statistics for all continuous variables.
# Any NaN values are automatically skipped in these statistics.
#
# This will show:
#
# the count of that variable
# the mean
# the standard deviation (std)
# the minimum value
# the IQR (Interquartile Range: 25%, 50% and 75%)
# the maximum value
